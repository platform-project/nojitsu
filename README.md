## The Story of nojitsu
The basic premise is borrowed from the theory behind the law of conservation of energy.

As we all know, Energy can be neither created nor be destroyed, but it transforms from one form to another, for instance chemical energy can be converted to kinetic energy in the explosion of a stick of dynamite.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist.
